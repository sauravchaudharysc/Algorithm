## Space Time Complexity Analysis

To check the performance of algorithms.We use space time complexity analysis.In general our preference must be given to time.But is there is short of memory then we should tradeoff in time.But space tradeoff is done always.
<br>
Time and Space both are function of N(Input Size).
<br>
Analysis can be done in two approach :- <br>
1.Practical
2.Theoretical

The first approach in infeasible because we cant always run each code and check it.
