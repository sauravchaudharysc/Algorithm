## Space Time Complexity Analysis

To check the performance of algorithms.We use space time complexity analysis.In general our preference must be given to time.But is there is short of memory then we should tradeoff in time.But space tradeoff is done always.
<br>
Time and Space both are function of N(Input Size).
<br>
Analysis can be done in two approach :- <br>
1.Practical<br>
2.Theoretical<br>
<br>
The first approach in infeasible because we cant always run each code and check it.
Time Complexity
Order Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity is amount of time taken by the algorithm to run as
a function of the input size
Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or
memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of
the input.
## Time Complexity Notation
1. Theta notation bounds a functions from above and below, so it
defines exact asymptotic behavior.<br>
2. Big O Notation defines an upper bound of an algorithm, it bounds
a function only from above.<br>
3. Omega notation provides an asymptotic lower bound.<br>

Various types of time complexities which can be analyzed for the
algorithm:<br>
Best case time complexity: Calculating lower bound on running
time of an algorithm and is the time taken in the case that causes
minimum number of operations to be executed.<br>
Worst case time Complexity: Calculating upper bound on
running time of an algorithm and is the time taken in the case that
causes maximum number of operations to be executed.<br>
Average Time complexity Algorithm: In average case analysis,
we take all possible inputs and calculate computing time for all of
the inputs. Sum all the calculated values and divide the sum by
total number of inputs.<br>
