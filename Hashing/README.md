# Hashing/Hash Table Data Structure
Suppose you visit a restaurant.You want to order few item.<br>
 i.  Burger :- 120 <br>
 ii. Shake :- 80<br>
 ii. Noodles :- 90<br>
 
To find the price of burger one way you can do the linear search.But it 
isnt efficient.So you can the waiter and he will reply you in a instant.
This happens because he has a mapping of price and food in his mind.
So you are making a search query and it should be done in O(1) time.<br>
This is the purpose of HashTable.

## Purpose 
    1. To Perform Insertion,deletion and search in average-case constant time.
    2. This data-structure isnt useful for if you want to maintain and retrieve
       some kind of an order of the elements.

## Hash Function
    1.  Hash["string key"] ==> Integer Value

## Key Components
    1.  Hash Function
    2.  Hash Table
    3.  Collision Handling Scheme
