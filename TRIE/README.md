# TRIE Data Structure
Problem :- List of Strings "No","Not","News","Hello","Apple"...........<br>
Queries : Is Not present or not ??<br>
We can use brute force but it will take O(nm).<br>
We can use hashing and its a better aprroach.<br>
We can build a prefix tree. And that prefix tree is called trie.<br>

Application of trie in real life. For phone number we can use trie.Because in phone number lot of prefix are same .So if you want to store large amount of number in phone directory trie would be a better option. But for 1000 contacts hashmap is a better option because trie use large amount of memory.
